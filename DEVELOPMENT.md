# Development Notes

## Current Status

### M0: Baseline Verification - PARTIAL
- Android SDK not available in current environment
- Cannot build/test Android APK at this time
- Moving forward with desktop implementation to demonstrate architecture

### Environment Setup Required
To complete Android verification:
1. Install Android SDK
2. Set ANDROID_HOME or update local.properties with sdk.dir
3. Run `./gradlew :app:installDebug`

### Next Steps
- Proceed with M1: Desktop Bootstrap
- Implement multimode architecture
- Document Android build requirements for future setup

## Architecture Progress

The multimode architecture will separate concerns as follows:
- Core simulation logic (platform-independent)
- Platform adapters (Android vs Desktop)
- Control systems (Human vs MCP)
- Application wiring (Android APK vs Desktop JAR)

This separation will allow the same game logic to run on both platforms with appropriate input/output adapters.
